# deep_draw
Convolution neural network... for draw video poker. Perhaps, we learn something useful for other poker, too.

Assume Python 2.7, and some modules require Theano.

Other modules depend on Lasagne (a wrapper for easier Theano building). https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne
Add Lasagne to your PYTHON_PATH to access.

Basic use cases...

Generate data:

Play draw hands with a decision process (random decision is default):

Train a neural network (non-convolution):

Train a convolution network to predict best choice: 

Train a convolution network to predict average values for all 32 draw conditions:

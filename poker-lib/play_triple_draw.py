Author: Nikolai Yakovenko
Copyright: PokerPoker, LLC 2015

A system for playing heads-up triple-draw poker, with both players simulated by AI.

As such, the game is run by a dealer, who controls actions, a deck, which can be drawn from,
player hands, and player agents... which make decisions, when propted, ultimately by querying an AI system.

The game is hard-coded to implement triple draw. But should be possible, to switch rules,
models and final hand evaluations, to accomodate any other draw game.
